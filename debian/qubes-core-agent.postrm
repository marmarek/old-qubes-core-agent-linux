# The prerm script may be called in the following ways:
#   * <postrm> 'remove'
#   * <postrm> 'purge'
#   * <old-postrm> 'upgrade' <new-version>
#   * <disappearer's-postrm> 'disappear' <overwriter> <overwriter-version>
#
#     The postrm script is called after the package's files have been removed
# or replaced. The package whose postrm is being called may have previously been
# deconfigured and only be "Unpacked", at which point subsequent package changes
# do not consider its dependencies. Therefore, all postrm actions may only rely
# on essential packages and must gracefully skip any actions that require the
# package's dependencies if those dependencies are unavailable.[48]
#
#   * <new-postrm> 'failed-upgrade' <old-version>
#
#     Called when the old postrm upgrade action fails. The new package will be
# unpacked, but only essential packages and pre-dependencies can be relied on.
# Pre-dependencies will either be configured or will be "Unpacked" or
# "Half-Configured" but previously had been configured and was never removed.
#
#   * <new-postrm> 'abort-install'
#   * <new-postrm> 'abort-install' <old-version>
#   * <new-postrm> 'abort-upgrade' <old-version>
#
#     Called before unpacking the new package as part of the error handling of
# preinst failures. May assume the same state as preinst can assume.
